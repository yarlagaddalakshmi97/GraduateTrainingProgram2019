## ProblemSet01

1. Write a program that examines three variables—x, y, and z—
and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it
should print a message to that effect.

2. Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so
the value of len('Cigna') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter 
and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

```python
>>> right_justify('Cigna')
																	 Cigna

```

3. Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and
then prints the largest odd number that was entered. If no odd number was
entered, it should print a message to that effect.

4. Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:
	```
	a) The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3pr3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
	Hint: 392.7 is wrong!
    b) Suppose the cover price of a book is Rs.24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs
	Rs.3 for the first copy and 0.75p for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for
	60 copies?
    c) If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at
	tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
    
	```
5. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and
prints two integers, root and pwr, such that 0 < pwr < 6 and root**pwr is equal
to the integer entered by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should
print a message to that effect.

6. Let s be a string that contains a sequence of decimal numbers
separated by commas, e.g., s = '1.23,2.4,3.123'. Write a program that prints
the sum of the numbers in s.

7. Write a function isIn() that accepts two strings as arguments
and returns True if either string occurs anywhere in the other, and False
otherwise. Hint: you might want to use the built-in str operation in.

8. Implement a function that satisfies the specification. Use a try-except block.

```python
def getRatios(vect1, vect2):
	"""Assumes: vect1 and vect2 are lists of equal length of numbers
	Returns: a list containing the meaningful values of
	vect1[i]/vect2[i]"""
```

9. Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
delimiter = '.'
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of
the expression).

```python
>>> width/2
>>> width/2.0
>>> height/3
>>> 1 + 2 * 5
>>> delimiter * 5
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers
```

10. Observe the Code Snippet
```python
x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
numGuesses = 0
low = 0.0
high = max(1.0, x)
ans = (high + low)/2.0
while abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon:
print 'low =', low, 'high =', high, 'ans =', ans
numGuesses += 1
if ans**2 < x:
low = ans
else:
high = ans
ans = (high + low)/2.0
print 'numGuesses =', numGuesses
print ans, 'is close to square root of', x

```

a. What would the code above return if the statement x = 25
were replaced by x = -25?

b. What would have to be changed to make the code above
for finding an approximation to the cube root of both negative and
positive numbers? (Hint: think about changing low to ensure that the answer
lies within the region being searched.)
